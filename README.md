# pala-one-firmware
Pala One — A tiny E-Ink reader project by Paul Lagier

The goal of the project was to create a simple, distraction-free reading device that feels minimal, portable and easy to build while still looking and behaving more like a real product than a typical DIY electronics project.

## Contributing

If you improve the firmware, add features or fix bugs, feel free to open a pull request.
Please clearly mention:
- which board version(s) you tested on (V1.1, V1.2, or both)
- what was changed
- how it was tested

## Board Versions

There are currently two supported Heltec Wireless Paper versions:
- `Heltec V1.1`
- `Heltec V1.2`

The board version is usually printed on the back of the PCB.

Both versions are built from the same source file (`Pala_One_2_1/Pala_One_2_1.ino`). Open it in Arduino IDE and uncomment the `#define` at the top that matches your hardware before compiling.

## Apps

Apps are compiled separately and uploaded to the device via the WiFi web interface — no firmware rebuild needed. The Apps menu discovers all `.bin` files in `/apps/` on the device and lists them by name.

### Building an app

You need:
- The `xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc` cross-compiler, which ships with the Arduino ESP32 board package. On Linux it is found under `~/.arduino15/packages/esp32/tools/esp-x32/<version>/bin/`; the `Makefile` locates it automatically.
- `python3` (for the post-build step that patches the entry point offset into the binary).

An app is a single C file that includes `pala_app.h` and `pala_api.h` from the firmware source and exports a `void app_main(const PalaAPI* api)` entry point. The header struct at the start of the binary carries the display name and API version check.

See `examples/click_counter/` for a complete working example with a `Makefile`.

```bash
cd examples/click_counter
make
# produces click_counter.bin
```

### Uploading an app

1. Select **Upload** from the library menu on the device.
2. Connect to the `PALA-XXXXXX` WiFi network (password: `palaread`).
3. Open `http://192.168.4.1` in a browser.
4. Use the **Upload app (.bin)** card to upload your `.bin` file.
5. Triple-click to exit upload mode — the app will appear in the Apps menu immediately.

### App API

Apps communicate with the firmware through the `PalaAPI` function pointer table passed to `app_main`. The current API version is **v3** (`PALA_API_VERSION 3` in `pala_app.h`).

#### Display

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `clearScreen()` | Clear the display buffer and prepare a new frame |
| `drawHeader(title)` | Draw the standard section header bar |
| `drawTextAt(x, y, text, bold)` | Draw text at a pixel position |
| `drawCenteredLarge(text)` | Draw text centred on screen in a large font |
| `refreshDisplay()` | Push the frame buffer to the e-ink panel |

#### Input

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `waitForEvent()` | Block until a button gesture; returns `PALA_CLICK` / `PALA_DOUBLE` / `PALA_TRIPLE` / `PALA_LONG` |
| `pollEvent()` | Non-blocking variant; returns 0 if no event is ready |
| `buttonPressed()` | Returns 1 if the button is currently held, 0 otherwise |
| `pendingPresses()` | Count of individual short press-release events since last call; bypasses multi-click grouping |

#### Timing

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `millisNow()` | Current uptime in milliseconds |
| `delayMs(ms)` | Yield for `ms` milliseconds |
| `rtcSeconds()` | Monotonic seconds counter that survives deep sleep; use for cross-session timing |

#### Storage

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `storageRead(key, buf, maxlen)` | Read from `/apps/{key}.dat`; returns bytes read, -1 on error |
| `storageWrite(key, buf, len)` | Write to `/apps/{key}.dat`; returns bytes written, -1 on error |

#### Utilities

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `snprintf_wrap(buf, len, fmt, ...)` | Standard `snprintf` |

Return from `app_main` to exit back to the Apps menu. Apps decide their own exit gesture — the firmware does not impose one.

**Constraints:**
- Apps must be compiled `-fPIC -mlongcalls` (position-independent).
- Apps must not use static mutable variables — the loader does not patch `.data` relocations.
- Maximum binary size: 48 KB.
- The `api_version` field in `PalaAppHeader` must match `PALA_API_VERSION` exactly — the firmware rejects mismatched binaries.

## Features

- TXT book support
- Adjustable font size
- Adjustable line spacing
- Deep sleep mode
- Reading progress saving
- USB-C charging
- Lightweight portable design
- Open-source firmware

## Hardware

Pala One is based on:
- Heltec Wireless Paper
- 3D printed housing
- LiPo battery
